This project showcases the steps we took in putting together an analysis on Amazon Video Game Merchandise.

The file "amazon_best_sellers_gaming_merchandise_2024.csv" is the original spreadsheet that we performed our analysis upon.

The Python file "Amazon_Gaming_Merch_2024.py" was first used to clean up the data and prepare it for further analysis in Microsoft Excel.

In the Excel file, "amazon_gaming_merch_updated.xlsx", you can see interactive dashboards we created to visualize the data. We also showcase use of advanced excel techniques to dig deep into the data.

Enjoy!
